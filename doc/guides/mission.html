    <p>CanJS's mission is to <strong>minimize the cost of building and maintaining
JavaScript applications by balancing innovation and stability, helping developers transcend a changing technology landscape</strong>.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have to rewrite your application to keep pace with technology.
So we constantly integrate new ideas and evolving best practices into CanJS libraries,
but in a responsible way that makes possible to
upgrade gracefully. We aim to provide a stable
and innovative platform, so you can block out noise and stay focused your app, not the tools.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Stability and innovation matter</h2>
<h3>Why stability matters</h3>
<p>Technology changes quickly, but applications last a long time.</p>
<p>From inception, a successful application (like Gmail) aims to last at least 5 years.</p>
<p><img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/introduction/app-longevity.png" style="width:100%;max-width:650px"/></p>
<p>Many frameworks, after a short period of popularity, end up fizzling out in a slow death, bombing out in a fast one, or not respecting their users with non-backwards compatible new versions.</p>
<p>Productivity-wise, over the life of your application, that ends up looking like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/introduction/betting-bomb.png" style="width:100%;max-width:650px"/></p>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/introduction/betting-bomb-2.png" style="width:100%;max-width:650px"/></p>
<h3>Why Innovation Matters</h3>
<p>However, simply providing stability is not enough. Windows XP was a stable platform, but it sacrificed innovation for stability, causing stagnation.</p>
<p>Over the past 9 years that CanJS has been around, there has been constant change in the JavaScript community. Best practices have evolved and the platform of the web itself has evolved. The pace may even be increasing as JavaScript gets more popular. Smart people are bringing Computer Science concepts from other domains onto JavaScript and the web, like streams and promises.</p>
<p>Even on a psychological level, working on a framework that innovates is incredibly important for morale. Every developer wants to work using exciting, modern tools. That's why we're no longer writing IE6 applications.</p>
<h2>Stability is difficult in the JavaScript community</h2>
<p>You may be familiar with the
<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/javascript-fatigue-fatigue-66ffb619f6ce#.n5tt0jqhf">never-ending stream</a> of <a href="http://www.allenpike.com/2015/javascript-framework-fatigue/">hot new JavaScript frameworks</a>
that take our community by storm:</p>
<p><img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/introduction/frameworks.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:750px"/></p>
<p>With a 1-2 year average turnover in the JavaScript framework game of thrones and a 5 year application lifespan, it’s safe to say that choosing frameworks based on popularity is not a good idea.</p>
<p>For example, say you were building an application and using the most popular choice at the time…</p>
<p><strong>4 years ago</strong> - You might have chosen KnockoutJS, which is a project that is no longer considered a modern framework and hasn’t been updated in some time.</p>
<p><strong>3 years ago</strong> - You might have chosen BackboneJS, which is a project that is no longer considered a modern framework and hasn’t been updated in some time.</p>
<p><strong>2 years ago</strong> - You might have chosen Angular 1, which is a project that was rewritten completely in version 2, without any backwards compatibility. You would have to rewrite your application to use a modern framework.</p>
<p><strong>1 year ago</strong> - You might have chosen React, before any of the many React frameworks like Redux became popular. You likely would have built your own mini-framework around React, or used the very lightweight Flux pattern that Facebook promotes, all of which would require a rewrite to use what is now considered a modern framework.</p>
<p><strong>Today</strong> - You might consider using Angular 2, but then realize you’ve already fallen for this trap. There must be a better way.</p>
<p>This is insanity. No reasonable developer should be expected to work like this. CanJS’s entire mission is to help developers weather this storm.</p>
<h2>Our history of stability and innovation</h2>
<p>If <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f#.lrntx9nby">chasing the hot new thing</a> isn’t for you, CanJS is the right framework for you.</p>
<p>CanJS’s goal is to be the antidote to this mentality, and we have the track record to prove it.</p>
<h3>Our history of stability</h3>
<p>CanJS, which was originally called JavaScriptMVC before that project was split up into several pieces, including CanJS, in 2012, has been around since 2007. Every year, we have aimed to improve our stack by incorporating the latest best practices and ideas in the JavaScript world, while not leaving behind our existing users.</p>
<p>Had you chosen CanJS during any of the past 4 years (actually any year since 2007), you’d have a smooth upgrade path each year until the present 3.0 version, which shares many major characterics with Angular 2 and React’s more popular frameworks, but without the stink of broken promises.</p>
<p>But choosing CanJS would have looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/introduction/good-bet.png" style="width:100%;max-width:650px"/></p>
<p>Or more specifically, here’s what our major release schedule has looked like:</p>
<p><img src="../../docs/can-guides/images/introduction/best-bet.png" style="width:100%;max-width:650px"/></p>
<p>Notice the consistent 6 to 9 month release cadence.</p>
<h3>Our history of innovation</h3>
<p>Over the past 9 years of CanJS, the web has evolved, and the best practices in JavaScript application development have changed. As these changes have occurred, CanJS has filtered out the very best ideas and practices, and implemented them in evolving APIs.</p>
<p>To name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Event delegation became a best practice for managing events around 2009. CanJS added support for event delegation in can.Controls in 2008, before jQuery even landed support.</li>
<li>RESTful APIs eventually became the best practice for designing a backend interface. can.Model in 2010 provided ActiveRecord style abstractions around this pattern.</li>
<li>Data bindings hit the mainstream in 2013 when Angular rose in popularity. CanJS landed support for this feature in 2011.</li>
<li>Building UI widgets as HTML custom elements, similar to web components, has become a best practice. can.Component landed in 2013 to support this architecture.</li>
<li>In 2015, CanJS landed support for using a Virtual DOM and simple server-side rendering, as this idea was becoming more popular.</li>
</ul>
<p>This timeline shows more examples:</p>

<h3>What we're doing to ensure future stability</h3>
<p>Given that the web is constantly changing, how do you balance the opposing forces of stability and innovation?</p>
<p>There are two ways CanJS is positioned to achieve even more stability in the future:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modularity with semantic versioning</li>
<li>Upgrade paths</li>
</ol>
<h4>1. Modularity with semantic versioning</h4>
<p>As of the 3.0 release, CanJS has been broken up into several dozen completely independent modules, each with it’s own separate npm package and version number using <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>
<p>Semantic versioning is important because it provides promises about releases and their potential impact on applications. Minor version upgrades, while they may support new features, will always be backwards-compatible. Upgrading to anything besides a major version will not break existing code.</p>
<p>Modularity allows future features to be added via new NPM modules that share common dependencies with the old modules. In most frameworks, adding a new feature means upgrading to a new version, which requires either running two versions in one page (a lot of code weight that slows down page load) or wholesale upgrade of the application.</p>
<p>CanJS modularity means developers can incorporate new library features without requiring a rewrite of the rest of the application or extra code weight. More on this <a href="technical.html#Modularity">here</a>.</p>
<h4>2. Upgrade paths</h4>
<p>For major version upgrades, such as 3.0, we provide an easy path to upgrade. For example, if you are an existing CanJS user using version 2.x looking to upgrade to the current version (3.0), there are three options, which all exist on a spectrum, each providing a tradeoff between work now and work later.</p>
